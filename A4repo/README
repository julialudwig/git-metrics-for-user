This directory contains the implementation of sillyCommand.sh.   At the
time of writing of this README file we know that it will take at least
one argument.

Now, the sillyCommand.sh command will tell you that it needs at least one argument.
If you give "hello" as the first argument, sillyCommand.sh will print out "You typed HELLO"
If you give "goodbye" as the first argumnet, sillyCommand.sh will print out "You types GOODBYE"
Otherwise, sillyCommand.sh will simply echo back the first argument.

We'll update this file with a detailed description as soon as we know
what the command will do!
